					<p>The current process for filing U.S. government forms is outdated and stressful, and is exacerbated when filers are not fluent in English.
						Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, these issues are brought to the spotlight: of the hundreds of thousands of unemployment applications made in Florida
						since the unemployment wave hit the U.S., only 4% of applicants have received their benefits.
						In New York and California, where 23% and 27% of the population is non-native, respectively, millions of residents, 
						particularly the elderly and those from low-income, low-tech households or minority backgrounds, have had trouble filing much-needed unemployment claims.
						While the state governments may offer translation services on their websites, applications themselves must be filed in either English or Spanish, 
						and almost all forms of filing instructions and assistance are also conveyed in English. With over 22 million new unemployment cases since the outbreak of COVID-19, 
						people from all backgrounds need easier access to their unemployment benefits and to the government form filing process as a whole.</p>

					</div>
					<p>EasyGov was founded to do just that: make the government form process as seamless as possible. It's simple—we offer simple walkthroughs for the most common
						government forms, through which you can submit your basic information in a language of your choice. This is used to autocomplete your respective forms,
						which, once complete, are filed via our partnerships with nonprofits and pro-bono lawyers. Our database management system organizes client information to
						optimize the process on our partners' ends too, presenting information in a clean manner and facilitating the form submission process. No matter your native
						language, background, or status, EasyGov is your one-stop shop for getting the unemployment benefits or citizenship approval you deserve, both during the
						global crisis and well after.
